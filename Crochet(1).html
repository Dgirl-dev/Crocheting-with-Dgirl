            <h2 class="C">What is Crocheting?</h2>
            <p class="D">
                Crocheting is an action which involves someone using a hooked needle to wool or thread inorder to make patterned stitches.
                 These stitches are woven together in a specific way(s) to create usable or decorative materials.

                    In this website, you will be getting info and practical examples of everything crochet.

                <h3><em>For fun:</em></h3>
                <p class="E">
	Crocheting can be done with different kinds of colours, wool textures, and decorations. 
    If you are someone who likes to create and design embroidery, then crocheting is just one 
    of the many things you can do. Crocheting also helps you to unlock that innovative and 
    colourful side you never knew. You do not need to have a paint brush in your hand and a 
    canvas to be called an artist. All you need to do is open your mind and let the designs flow.
            </p>

                <h3><em>For business:</em></h3>
                <p class="E">
	Crocheting can serve as a means of income and revenue for an individual or a group of people. 
    Starting off a business in crocheting can be very useful even as a high school or college student. 
    It could help build you social status, pocket money, customer rates and extracurriculars. For me i
     feel like it is way better to start off things like this when you are in a kind of setting as in a 
     classroom. This is because you have a less difficult audience to reach, and from there you can start
      selling your products to their parents and friends, get involved in outdoor sales, create a shop
       online and you will easily gain lots of followers and loyal customers. Find out about what you need
        to start up your business <a href="#">here</a>.
            </p>

                <h3><em>Tradition:</em></h3>
            <p class="E">
	Now you may want to start crocheting because your great grandmother did it, your grandmother did it,
     your mother and the rest of your family did. That's ok, it's also a part of upholding tradition and
      can increase family bonding. Picture this: you great grandmother owned a very large company back in
       the day that specialised in crocheting? And it's still being talked about? Thats great and if i were 
       the one in your place i would be very proud of my family. Never be ashamed of your family. If you feel
        like there is anything they are doing that is wrong, draw their attention to it. Never give up on
         them and try to get away from them cause they wouldn't want to do the same to you.
            </p>


                <h3><em>Peace of mind/ calmness:</em></h3>
                <p class="E">
	Crocheting can be a good means for you to just escape all those piling assignments and work and focus on
     relaxing your mind in preparation of more work or the rest of your life. Everyone needs something soft 
     to balance out all the stress in their lives and crocheting can just be that thing. But if you are feeling
      stressed, drink some water too. ðŸ™‚ Crocheting also has some more medical advantages like reducing blood
       pressure and calming the brain.
